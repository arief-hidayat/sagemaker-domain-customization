## sagemaker-domain-customization

My personal guide/notes to customize Sagemaker domain.

Current notes:
* How to create and use custom Jupyterlab container image for your Jupyterlab Space in Sagemaker Studio. [See here](./jupyterlab-images)
* How to create custom EMR Serverless container image and use in your Sagemaker Studio. [See here](./emr-images)

Try at your own risk!
